"""Dynamic daily intro generation for all podcast shows.

Provides day-aware, show-specific intro lines that vary naturally so
listeners don't hear the exact same opening every day.  Each show defines
a personality (greeting style, energy descriptors, framing phrases) and
the system selects from these pools using the day-of-year as a seed —
deterministic within a day but different across days.

Usage in ``run_show.py``::

    from engine.intros import build_intro_line, build_closing_block
    intro = build_intro_line("tesla", episode_num=403, today_str="March 15, 2026")
    closing = build_closing_block("tesla", episode_num=403, today_str="March 15, 2026")

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Per-show personality pools
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Each show defines:
#   greetings   — opening words/phrases (e.g. "Hey,", "Good morning,")
#   openers     — the verb phrase after the show name (e.g. "episode {ep}")
#   framings    — the setup sentence before the hook lands
#   day_colors  — optional day-of-week overrides for energy/framing
#   closings    — pool of closing block variations
