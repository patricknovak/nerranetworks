            {"q": "What is FSD (Full Self-Driving)?", "a": "FSD is Tesla's advanced driver-assistance system that aims to enable fully autonomous driving. It uses cameras and neural networks to navigate roads, handle intersections, and park. As of 2026, FSD (Supervised) requires driver attention at all times — it's not yet fully autonomous, but Tesla is working toward unsupervised capability with its robotaxi program."},
            {"q": "What does 'shorts' mean in Tesla Shorts Time?", "a": "In stock market terminology, 'shorting' means betting that a stock's price will go down. Tesla has historically been one of the most-shorted stocks on the market. 'Tesla Shorts Time' plays on this — suggesting that time is running out for those betting against Tesla, as the company continues to grow and prove skeptics wrong."},
            {"q": "What is a Gigafactory?", "a": "A Gigafactory is Tesla's term for its massive manufacturing facilities. The name comes from 'giga' (billion) — these factories produce batteries and vehicles at a scale measured in gigawatt-hours. Tesla operates Gigafactories in Nevada, Shanghai, Berlin, and Texas, each producing hundreds of thousands of vehicles per year."},
            {"q": "What is the Tesla Megapack?", "a": "The Megapack is Tesla's utility-scale battery storage product. Each unit stores up to 4 MWh of energy — enough to power about 3,600 homes for one hour. Utilities and grid operators use Megapacks to store renewable energy from solar and wind farms, stabilize the grid, and replace fossil fuel peaker plants."},
            {"q": "What does TSLA's P/E ratio mean?", "a": "The Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio shows how much investors pay per dollar of Tesla's earnings. A high P/E (Tesla's is often 50-100+) means investors expect strong future growth. For comparison, traditional automakers trade at P/E ratios of 5-15. Tesla's premium reflects the market pricing in its AI, energy, and robotaxi potential beyond just car sales."},

        "faq": [
            {"q": "What is media bias?", "a": "Media bias is the tendency of a news outlet to present information in a way that favors a particular political viewpoint, ideology, or narrative. It can appear in story selection (what gets covered), framing (how it's described), word choice, and source selection. Every outlet has some degree of bias — the key is recognizing it and reading multiple perspectives."},
            {"q": "What's the difference between news and opinion?", "a": "News reporting aims to present facts — who, what, when, where, why — with minimal editorial interpretation. Opinion pieces (editorials, columns, op-eds) express the author's views and arguments about those facts. Many outlets mix both, which is why media literacy matters. Look for labels like 'Opinion,' 'Analysis,' or 'Editorial' to distinguish them."},
            {"q": "What is a wire service?", "a": "A wire service (like AP, Reuters, or AFP) is a news organization that gathers and distributes news to other media outlets. They focus on straight factual reporting without editorial slant, because their stories are used by newspapers, TV stations, and websites across the political spectrum. Wire service reports are generally considered among the most reliable news sources."},
            {"q": "How do I identify misinformation?", "a": "Check multiple sources — if only one outlet reports something, be skeptical. Look at the source's track record on fact-checking databases. Check if the story cites primary sources (documents, studies, official statements). Be wary of emotional headlines, anonymous sources without corroboration, and stories that perfectly confirm your existing beliefs. When in doubt, check FactCheck.org or Snopes."},
            {"q": "Why does Omni View cover sources from 'both sides'?", "a": "Because no single perspective has a monopoly on truth. Stories look different depending on which facts are emphasized, which sources are quoted, and what context is provided. By presenting perspectives from across the political spectrum, Omni View helps you see the full picture and form your own informed opinions — rather than having your views shaped by a single outlet's editorial choices."},

            {"q": "What is an exoplanet?", "a": "An exoplanet is a planet that orbits a star outside our solar system. Over 5,700 exoplanets have been confirmed as of 2026, with thousands more candidates awaiting verification. They range from scorching hot Jupiters to potentially habitable rocky worlds. NASA's TESS and the James Webb Space Telescope are the primary tools for finding and studying them."},
            {"q": "How does the James Webb Space Telescope work?", "a": "JWST is an infrared space telescope with a 6.5-meter gold-coated mirror (compared to Hubble's 2.4m). It orbits the Sun at the L2 Lagrange point, 1.5 million km from Earth, where its sunshield keeps instruments at -233C. By observing in infrared, Webb can see through cosmic dust, study the atmospheres of exoplanets, and detect light from the earliest galaxies formed after the Big Bang."},
            {"q": "What is a light-year?", "a": "A light-year is the distance light travels in one year — about 9.46 trillion kilometers (5.88 trillion miles). It's used because space distances are so vast that kilometers become meaningless. For scale: the nearest star (Proxima Centauri) is 4.24 light-years away. The Milky Way galaxy is about 100,000 light-years across. The observable universe extends 46 billion light-years in every direction."},
            {"q": "What's the difference between NASA, ESA, and SpaceX?", "a": "NASA (US) and ESA (Europe) are government space agencies funded by taxpayers — they do science, exploration, and Earth observation. SpaceX is a private company founded by Elon Musk that builds rockets and spacecraft. SpaceX focuses on making space access cheaper (reusable Falcon 9, Starship), while NASA and ESA define scientific missions. They often work together — SpaceX launches NASA astronauts to the ISS."},
            {"q": "How can I see the ISS?", "a": "The International Space Station is the third brightest object in the night sky (after the Sun and Moon). It looks like a fast-moving bright star crossing the sky in 3-5 minutes. Use NASA's Spot The Station website or the Heavens-Above app to get exact times for your location. Best sightings happen just after sunset or before sunrise when the station catches sunlight against a dark sky."},

Longevity researchers increasingly focus on healthspan because living to 100 matters less if the last 20 years are spent in poor health. The goal is to compress morbidity — keeping you healthy and active until very late in life."},

Think of it as molecular scissors with a GPS — you can target a specific gene and change it. It's being used to develop treatments for sickle cell disease, certain cancers, and inherited genetic conditions. The 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded for this technology."},
            {"q": "What are senolytics?", "a": "Senolytics are drugs that selectively destroy senescent cells — 'zombie cells' that have stopped dividing but refuse to die. These cells accumulate with age and secrete inflammatory signals that damage surrounding tissue, contributing to aging and age-related diseases. Senolytic drugs like dasatinib + quercetin and fisetin are being studied in clinical trials. Early results suggest they may improve physical function and reduce inflammation in older adults."},
            {"q": "What is NAD+ and why does it matter?", "a": "NAD+ (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) is a coenzyme found in every cell that's essential for energy metabolism, DNA repair, and cellular signaling. NAD+ levels decline with age — by age 50, you may have half the NAD+ you had at 20. Researchers like David Sinclair believe boosting NAD+ (via precursors like NMN or NR) could slow aging. Clinical trials are underway, but results are still preliminary."},
            {"q": "What is a clinical trial?", "a": "A clinical trial is a research study that tests a medical treatment, drug, or intervention in human volunteers. Trials progress through phases: Phase 1 tests safety (small group), Phase 2 tests effectiveness (larger group), Phase 3 compares to existing treatments (thousands of participants), and Phase 4 monitors long-term effects after approval. You can search for trials at ClinicalTrials.gov — some actively recruit participants."},

            {"q": "What is CEPA?", "a": "The Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA 1999) is Canada's primary federal environmental law. It governs the assessment and management of toxic substances, pollution prevention, and environmental emergencies. CEPA gives the federal government authority to regulate chemicals, fuels, and wastes that pose risks to human health or the environment. It was significantly updated in 2023 (Bill S-5) to recognize the right to a healthy environment."},
            {"q": "What is a contaminated site?", "a": "A contaminated site is land or water where hazardous substances exceed regulatory standards and may pose risks to human health or the environment. Common contaminants include petroleum hydrocarbons (from gas stations), heavy metals (from industrial operations), chlorinated solvents (from dry cleaners), and PFAS (from firefighting foam). In BC, the Contaminated Sites Regulation (CSR) defines standards and the process for investigation, risk assessment, and remediation."},
            {"q": "What are PFAS?", "a": "PFAS (Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances) are a group of 12,000+ synthetic chemicals known as 'forever chemicals' because they don't break down in the environment. Used since the 1950s in non-stick coatings, food packaging, firefighting foam, and waterproof clothing, PFAS contaminate groundwater, soil, and drinking water worldwide. Health concerns include cancer, thyroid disease, and immune system effects. Canada is developing federal PFAS regulations, and remediation is extremely challenging and costly."},
            {"q": "What is the CSR (Contaminated Sites Regulation)?", "a": "BC's Contaminated Sites Regulation sets numerical standards for soil, groundwater, vapour, and sediment quality. It defines when a site is 'contaminated' (exceeds standards) and the process for investigation, risk assessment, and remediation. Key concepts include: site profiles (disclosure triggers), preliminary and detailed site investigations, risk-based standards vs. generic standards, and certificates of compliance issued upon successful remediation."},
            {"q": "What does 'remediation' mean?", "a": "Remediation is the process of cleaning up contaminated land or groundwater to make it safe for its intended use. Methods include: excavation and disposal (dig-and-dump), in-situ treatment (treating contamination in place using bioremediation, chemical oxidation, or thermal treatment), pump-and-treat (extracting and treating groundwater), and risk management (containing contamination with barriers or institutional controls). The approach depends on contaminant type, site geology, and intended land use."},

            {"q": "What is an LLM?", "a": "A Large Language Model (LLM) is an AI system trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human language. Models like GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and Llama are LLMs. They work by predicting the most likely next token (word piece) in a sequence, but this simple mechanism produces remarkably capable systems that can write code, analyze documents, reason through problems, and hold conversations."},
            {"q": "What is an AI agent?", "a": "An AI agent is a system that uses an LLM as its 'brain' to autonomously plan and execute multi-step tasks. Unlike a simple chatbot that responds to one message at a time, an agent can break down complex goals, use tools (web search, code execution, APIs), observe results, and iterate. Examples include coding agents (Cursor, Claude Code), research agents (Perplexity), and browser agents that navigate websites on your behalf."},
            {"q": "What is RAG?", "a": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that gives LLMs access to external knowledge by retrieving relevant documents before generating a response. Instead of relying solely on training data, a RAG system searches a database (using vector embeddings), finds relevant passages, and includes them in the LLM's context. This reduces hallucinations and lets you build AI that can answer questions about your own documents, codebase, or data."},
            {"q": "What is fine-tuning?", "a": "Fine-tuning is the process of further training a pre-trained LLM on a specific dataset to specialize it for a particular task or domain. For example, you might fine-tune Llama on medical literature to create a healthcare-specific model. It's more expensive than RAG but can teach the model new behaviors, styles, or domain expertise that prompt engineering alone can't achieve. Most developers start with RAG and only fine-tune when necessary."},
            {"q": "What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?", "a": "MCP is an open protocol (created by Anthropic) that standardizes how AI models connect to external data sources and tools. Think of it as a USB-C port for AI — instead of building custom integrations for every tool, MCP provides a universal interface. An MCP server can expose databases, APIs, file systems, or any tool, and any MCP-compatible AI client can use them. It's rapidly becoming the standard for agent tool connectivity."},

            {"q": "What is AI?", "a": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is technology that enables computers to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence — like understanding language, recognizing images, making decisions, and learning from experience. Modern AI systems learn from huge amounts of data rather than following explicit rules. When you use ChatGPT, Google Translate, or Instagram filters, you're using AI."},
            {"q": "What is a 'model'?", "a": "An AI model is the trained 'brain' of an AI system. It's created by feeding a computer program enormous amounts of data and letting it find patterns. For example, a language model like GPT or Claude was trained on billions of pages of text, so it learned how language works. The word 'model' just means 'a simplified representation of something' — an AI model is a simplified representation of human knowledge and reasoning."},
            {"q": "Is AI dangerous?", "a": "Like any powerful technology, AI has risks and benefits. Current AI can spread misinformation, create deepfakes, and be biased against certain groups. Long-term, researchers debate whether very advanced AI could be hard to control. But AI also helps doctors diagnose diseases, scientists discover new medicines, and students learn faster. The key is developing AI responsibly — with safety research, regulation, and public awareness. Understanding AI helps you use it wisely."},
            {"q": "Can AI replace my job?", "a": "AI is more likely to change jobs than eliminate them entirely. It's very good at repetitive, pattern-based tasks (data entry, basic writing, image sorting) but struggles with creativity, empathy, physical dexterity, and complex judgment. Most experts predict AI will become a powerful tool that makes workers more productive — like how calculators didn't replace mathematicians but changed what they focus on. The best strategy is learning to work WITH AI, not compete against it."},
            {"q": "What's the difference between ChatGPT and Google Gemini?", "a": "Both are AI chatbots powered by large language models, but they're made by different companies with different strengths. ChatGPT (by OpenAI) was the first widely popular AI chatbot and is known for creative writing and coding. Gemini (by Google) is integrated with Google Search and services, so it's good at finding current information. Claude (by Anthropic) is known for careful reasoning and safety. Try all three — they're all free to use — and see which you prefer!"},

            {"q": "Что такое TFSA?", "a": "Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) — это канадский сберегательный счёт, на котором вся прибыль от инвестиций не облагается налогом. Каждый год правительство увеличивает лимит взносов (в 2026 году — $7,000). Вы можете инвестировать в акции, ETF, облигации и GIC внутри TFSA, и все доходы — дивиденды, проценты, прирост капитала — остаются полностью вашими. Это один из лучших инструментов для долгосрочных сбережений в Канаде."},
            {"q": "Что такое RRSP?", "a": "Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) — это пенсионный сберегательный план. Главное отличие от TFSA: взносы в RRSP уменьшают ваш налогооблагаемый доход в текущем году (вы получаете налоговый возврат), но при снятии денег на пенсии вы платите налог. RRSP выгоден, если сейчас ваш доход (и налоговая ставка) выше, чем будет на пенсии. Лимит взносов — 18% от заработка прошлого года."},
            {"q": "Как начать инвестировать в Канаде?", "a": "Шаг 1: Откройте TFSA (максимально используйте налоговые льготы). Шаг 2: Выберите платформу — Wealthsimple (самая простая для начинающих) или Questrade (больше опций). Шаг 3: Начните с ETF широкого рынка, например XEQT или VGRO — они автоматически диверсифицированы по всему миру. Шаг 4: Инвестируйте регулярно (даже $50-100 в месяц), не пытайтесь угадать рынок. Время на рынке важнее, чем тайминг рынка."},
            {"q": "Что такое GIC?", "a": "Guaranteed Investment Certificate (GIC) — это гарантированный инвестиционный сертификат. Вы вкладываете деньги в банк на фиксированный срок (от 30 дней до 5 лет), и банк гарантирует возврат + проценты. GIC застрахованы CDIC до $100,000. Ставки зависят от срока и банка — сравнивайте на RateHub.ca. GIC подходят для краткосрочных сбережений (на первый взнос, фонд безопасности), но для долгосрочных целей ETF обычно приносят больше."},
            {"q": "Что такое кредитный рейтинг?", "a": "Кредитный рейтинг (credit score) — это число от 300 до 900, показывающее вашу кредитоспособность. В Канаде два бюро — Equifax и TransUnion. Рейтинг выше 700 считается хорошим, выше 750 — отличным. Он влияет на одобрение ипотеки, кредитных карт и процентные ставки. Чтобы улучшить рейтинг: платите вовремя, используйте менее 30% кредитного лимита, не закрывайте старые карты. Проверяйте бесплатно через Borrowell."},

        "faq": [
            {"q": "How hard is Russian to learn?", "a": "The US Foreign Service Institute rates Russian as a Category III language — harder than Spanish or French, but easier than Chinese, Japanese, or Arabic. For English speakers, the main challenges are the Cyrillic alphabet (learnable in a week), six grammatical cases (takes months to internalize), and verb aspect (perfective vs imperfective). The good news: Russian pronunciation is very regular — if you can read a word, you can pronounce it. With daily practice, expect basic conversational ability in 6-12 months."},
            {"q": "What is the Cyrillic alphabet?", "a": "Cyrillic is the alphabet used to write Russian (and Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Serbian, and others). It has 33 letters — some look and sound like English letters (A, K, M, O, T), some look familiar but sound different (B sounds like V, H sounds like N, P sounds like R, C sounds like S), and some are unique (Ж, Щ, Ы, Э). You can learn all 33 letters in about a week of focused practice. Once you know Cyrillic, you can sound out any Russian word."},
            {"q": "How many cases does Russian have?", "a": "Russian has six grammatical cases: Nominative (subject), Genitive (possession/of), Dative (to/for), Accusative (direct object), Instrumental (by/with), and Prepositional (about/in). Cases change the endings of nouns, adjectives, and pronouns depending on their role in the sentence. English handles this with word order and prepositions; Russian uses endings. It sounds intimidating, but you learn them gradually — start with Nominative and Accusative, then add others as you progress."},
            {"q": "What's the difference between ты and вы?", "a": "Both mean 'you,' but ты (tee) is informal/singular and вы (vee) is formal/plural. Use ты with friends, family, children, and pets. Use вы with strangers, older people, professionals, and in formal situations. Вы (capitalized Вы) is also used as a polite singular 'you' — like saying 'sir' or 'ma'am' in English. Using the wrong form isn't a disaster, but switching from вы to ты with someone signals that you've become friends — it's a meaningful social moment in Russian culture."},
            {"q": "How long does it take to learn Russian?", "a": "It depends on your goals and daily practice. With 30 minutes/day: basic greetings and survival phrases in 1-2 months, simple conversations in 4-6 months, comfortable intermediate level in 12-18 months. The FSI estimates 1,100 classroom hours for professional proficiency. Key accelerators: daily consistency (even 15 minutes beats occasional long sessions), native speaker practice (italki or Tandem), and immersion through media (Russian music, YouTube, Netflix shows with subtitles). This podcast is designed to be one of those daily touchpoints!"},

It's the most powerful wealth-building tool for most Canadians because you never pay tax on withdrawals."},

ETFs like VFV (S&P 500), XEQT (global equities), or VGRO (balanced growth) let you diversify across hundreds of companies with a single purchase. They typically have much lower fees than mutual funds — often 0.05-0.25% per year vs 2%+ for mutual funds."},
            {"q": "What does 'outperform index funds' mean?", "a": "Index funds like the S&P 500 (which returned ~10% annually over the last century) are the benchmark. 'Outperforming' means earning higher returns through active strategies — momentum trading, sector rotation, value picks, or options. Most active managers fail to beat the index over 10+ years, which is why we track our simulated trades honestly. The goal is education: understanding WHY strategies work or fail."},
